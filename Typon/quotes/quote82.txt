I have always wanted to be fluent in another language. Some linguists say that the best way to learn a second language is to learn it just like a child learns. But how can an adult learn like a child? Adults have inhibitions that children don't have. We are afraid to be wrong, that's what makes learning so hard. When you conquer that fear, you can learn just about anything.
