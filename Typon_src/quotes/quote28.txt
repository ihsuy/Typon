The value of a leader is not measured in how one rules, but how well one serves others. Do not decide that someone can be a leader due to glamour and fame because these attributes are superficial and eventually disappear. If you lead by fear and intimidation, then all you have is your strong position. But if you lead with the strength of grace, mercy and love, then you will have a people.
