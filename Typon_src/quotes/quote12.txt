My Personality makes up me. I am funny, kind, wild, crazy, and so much more. I don't care about what people say, because that is what they think. I don't let that get me down. We only live once, and I am not going to let stupid stuff bring me down or stop me. I have a great personality, I can communicate with anyone, even if I don't like them, because I don't care about colors, voices, images, or shapes, I care about their personalities. They keep me going.
